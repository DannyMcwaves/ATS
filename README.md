#ATS
**Applicant tracking system**

NB: this is not a full readme just yet

myAPP/Django_project is where the django project will be based

the scrapebot will use scrapy and parsel for web data mining

the nlp is for natural language processing where most of the logic will take place

tests will use py.test for testing

the basic structure.

scrapy.cfg -- basic scrapy configfurations

setup.cfg -- basic setup configuration

In case of any database base needs. We will either sql or mongoDB
I am good with both.

for cross data handling -- can we sqlite data formats.
I want the nlp to temporarily put data in a database instead of a file so you can read it easily with django

##### Just a starter.
